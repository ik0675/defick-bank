# Defick-bank

Basic concept of this project is by using a blockchain to create a decentralized bank where a user puts money into it and it will give back an interest based on how long a user put one's money with a token(cryptocurrency) as a payback.

The reason that a bank lend money from users is that there is supply/demand on certain cryptocurrency due to PoS(Proof of Stake). A user may be chosen as a stakeholder who will received an opportunity to mine cryptocurrency.
